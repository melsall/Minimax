### What is Nim?

Nim is a two player game involving a number of different piles of objects. The piles can have differing amounts of objects. The goal of the game is to not be the player to take the last object. You may take as many objects as you want at a time, but you may not take objects from more than one pile within a single turn. The two players alternate taking objects. The game continues until someone is forced to take the last object, and they lose. This game is zero-sum, meaning if one player wins, the other will lose and vice versa.

There is another version of Nim called SimpleNim. In SimpleNim, there is one pile of objects and each player may only take 1, 2, or 3 objects in a single turn. This game is still zero-sum, and whichever player takes the last object still loses.
