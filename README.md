- What is Nim? - 
Nim is a two player game involving some different of objects. The goal of the game is to not be the player to take the last object. You may take as many objects as you want at a time, but you may not take objects from more than one pile within a given turn. The turns are alternating. The game continues until someone is forced to take the last object, and they lose. This game is zero-sum, meaning if one player wins, the other will lose and vice versa.

There is another version of Nim called "simple Nim." In simple Nim, there is one pile of objects and each player may only take 1, 2, or 3 objects in a single turn.
